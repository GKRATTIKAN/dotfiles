# Instructions

Clone the repo with
```bash
git clone http://github.com/dodgejcr/dotfiles.git
``` 
Now move all the files where you need them. If is marked with a '.' then the file belongs in your ~/ directory

If not, it belongs in ~/.config

## Font

I have included the powerline font <Consola> that you need to move to /usr/share/fonts/TTF/
If you choose not to use the font, change the font line in .Xresources
